# AI_Zero

The goal of this project is to implement a version of DeepMind's AlphaZero algorithm. 

The initial version only supports training for Tic-Tac-Toe, but it learns the game in a few minutes.

Other features and support for other games are forthcoming. I believe that there is value in interpretability, so one of my priorities will be the visualization of game records and search trees.
